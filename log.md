### Day 1: August 15th, 2018 (Missing Persons)

**Today's Progress**: Creating the Frontend Layout of the Missing Persons Project in ReactJS.

### Day 2: August 16th, 2018 (Missing Persons)

**Today's Progress**: Still working on the fronted for the MPA Project in React

**Thoughts:** Really getting the hang of the react framework, thinking of rebuilding most of my project using it, though i 
have concerns about server-side rendering for the sake of SEO, I will have to take look at Next.JS, but in overall it really is 
beautiful the way react helps you organize your ui. I did face come challenges with router in the beginning, and also getting
[ReactStrap](https://reactstrap.github.io) to Work with RRouter, I learnt that you could rename class imports to suit this convention, not sure how scalable that is 
but as we move ahead, I will get to find out.

### Day 3: August 17th

**Today's Progress**: Completed major page layouts for the Missing Persons Project and deployed git repo to now.sh

**Thoughts:** deploying react projects is a funny puzzle, various options exists, now happened to be the easiest build and deploy tool though

### Day 6: August 20th

**Today's Progress:** Took sometime to look into (un)-ethical hacking, the topic is so much fun generally and i love it,  

**Thoughts:** i took sometime to read about google dorks, LFI and RFI, these techniques are prevalent in exploiting vulns in most php based websites. shell scripts to mention C9Shell, I took sometime browsing github for repos that had some decoded versions of this scripts to see and learn how they work, which is really elighntening, i however am not planning to hack anysite but i came across this project from Simone Masiero that makes you look like a cool hacker, which i deployed on a github page
