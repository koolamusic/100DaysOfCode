### Day 1: August 15th, 2018 (Missing Persons)

**Today's Progress**: Creating the Frontend Layout of the Missing Persons Project in ReactJS.

**Thoughts:** Struggling with grasping the react architecture again, would soon get router and states right soon.

### Day 2: August 16th, 2018 (Missing Persons)

**Today's Progress**: Still working on the fronted for the MPA Project in React

**Thoughts:** Really getting the hang of the react framework, thinking of rebuilding most of my project using it, though i 
have concerns about server-side rendering for the sake of SEO, I will have to take look at Next.JS, but in overall it really is beautiful the way react helps you organize your ui. I did face come challenges with router in the beginning, and also getting [ReactStrap](https://reactstrap.github.io) to Work with RRouter, I learnt that you could rename class imports to suit this convention, not sure how scalable that is but as we move ahead, I will get to find out.

### Day 3: August 17th

**Today's Progress**: Completed major page layouts for the Missing Persons Project and deployed git repo to now.sh

**Thoughts:** deploying react projects is a funny puzzle, various options exists, now happened to be the easiest build and deploy tool though

### Day 4: August 18th

**Today's Progress:** Today is saturday, not much code to write because of other household stuff, initialized page design for the senderon telegram community

**Thoughts:** frontend projects kinda help me relax, which is cool, didnt learn anything today so i just coded.

### Day 5: August 19th

**Today's Progress:** continued my sprint on senderon today, created four page screens, home, register, signup, reset password

**Thoughts:** discovered the surge.sh network, great for deploying static sites from the terminal, actually very easy and lovely

### Day 6: August 20th

**Today's Progress:** Took sometime to look into (un)-ethical hacking, the topic is so much fun generally and i love it,  

**Thoughts:** i took sometime to read about google dorks, LFI and RFI, these techniques are prevalent in exploiting vulns in most php based websites. shell scripts to mention C9Shell, I took sometime browsing github for repos that had some decoded versions of this scripts to see and learn how they work, which is really elighntening, i however am not planning to hack anysite but i came across this project from Simone Masiero that makes you look like a cool hacker, which i deployed on a github page

### Day 7: August 21th

**Today's Progress:** I didn't really code much today, had quite a lot of work to do and music related stuff

**Thoughts:** had quite some thoughts on how much can be achieved using the linux bash, so I have assigned myself a new challenge to create a bash script that can send html newsletters (challenge accepted)

### Day 7-14: August 21th - August 28th

**Week's Progress:** have been quite busy with a lot to keep up my logs, but have always pushed code and tracked with github

**Thoughts:** explored git webhooks, some more penetration testing (discovered some vulns in dotFiles that can be retrieved from external resources like git/HEAD/logs | etc) diving deeper into react, make meself a master lol. some php hacking and automation using bash, invoking shell commmands using php shell_exec() can be easy, but i am worried about security concerns though, found ways to mitigate having exposed dotfiles on the server.

### Day 15-25 : August 29th - September 9th

**Week's Progress:** learnt node and played around forms and mongoDB

**Thoughts:** exploring express was great, I did have concerns understanding the way most of the required modules are supposed to function and the methods/classes these modules expose for use.  interacting with the mongoose package was relatively comfortable, however resolving client side validation in forms to express on the server is still a roadblock, I will have to personal dig deeper into interacting with the express package and understanding the way it works.

### Day 26-35 : September 10th - September 18th

**Week's Progress:** CRUD, POST, GET, POSTMAN, API, EXPRESS, MONGOOSE,

**Thoughts:** Learning interacting with the MongoDB database using the npm mongoose package, mongoose validation and validation with joi, POST, GET, and working with POSTMAN to test API endpoints in express. while trying to implement this over an existing react project has not been successful, I think I'll take it a bit slow and try working with node APIs in a much easier method. dealing with mongoose sinks in perfectly well.
