### Day3: August 16th, 2018 (Missing Persons)

**Today's Progress**: Still working on the fronted for the MPA Project in React

**Thoughts:** Really getting the hang of the react framework, thinking of rebuilding most of my project using it, though i 
have concerns about server-side rendering for the sake of SEO, I will have to take look at Next.JS, but in overall it really is 
beautiful the way react helps you organize your ui. I did face come challenges with router in the beginning, and also getting
[ReactStrap](https://reactstrap.github.io) to Work with RRouter, I learnt that you could rename class imports to suit this convention, not sure how scalable that is 
but as we move ahead, I will get to find out.
